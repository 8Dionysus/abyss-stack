# Design

## Purpose

Agents need stack-owned runtime evidence without granting the stack semantic
authority over the direct owner adapters it operates.

The package therefore consumes one typed observation with explicit links:

```text
source
  -> package
  -> deploy
  -> process
  -> endpoint
  -> registry
  -> consumer schema observation
  -> grounded canary
  -> rollback evidence
```

Every link keeps its own state, timestamp, expiry, evidence refs, and reason
codes. Process activity is not endpoint readiness; endpoint readiness is not
owner-result freshness; consumer registration is not schema compatibility.

## Progressive surface

Catalog results are compact and deliberately omit detailed schemas. Inspection
loads one owner/policy subject and one view. A separate candidate process can
compile one bounded plan against the exact observation digest. No call invokes
an owner server or runtime lifecycle command.

## Authority

`abyss-stack` owns the observation and runtime-plan shape. Owner repositories
own capability and payload meaning. `aoa-sdk` owns registry discovery and
activation-plan compilation. `aoa-evals` owns central proof interpretation.
The named acceptance owner accepts durable source or memory changes.

The MCP stable production line remains `2025-11-25`. These contracts are
protocol-independent so a future adapter can coexist without changing runtime
authority.
